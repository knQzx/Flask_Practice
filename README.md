## Portfolio_Generator
This mini-project was made so that novice programmers could effortlessly make themselves a beautiful website that could then be shown. This is done on Flask, and I downloaded the original site from somewhere) The file has an object_Data dictionary in which there is filled in data, you have to change them for yourself. There is also a list of skills, in which you can add lists in which the first element is the percentage of how you know a particular skill, and the second element is the name of the skill, for example - ['80', 'Javascript'].
